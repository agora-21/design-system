### Updating font files

This Design System uses the Sans version of [IBM Plex typeface](ibm.com/plex). It is really cool!

The font files are located in `public/fonts/IBM-Plex-Sans`.

To update them:
1. head to IBM's [github page](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases), find the latest realease and download the `Web.zip` file
2. Unzip it and locate the IBM-Plex-Sans folder
3. Replace it in the repository's `public/fonts` folder
